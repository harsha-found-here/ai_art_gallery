                    <h3> What is AI generated Art??</h3>AI-generated art is artistic content created with the aid of artificial intelligence algorithms,
 such as neural networks like GANs and VAEs. 
 These algorithms learn from vast datasets of existing art to autonomously produce new and unique pieces without direct human intervention in the creative process.
